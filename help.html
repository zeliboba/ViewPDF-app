<h3 id="use">Usage</h3>
<p>Click the <b>Open</b> button to choose a PDF file to view. If the
Spelling dock window is visible any spelling mistakes or double-words
will be highlighted. If the annotations dock window is visible any
annotations will be visible. (So if you don't want to see spelling
mistakes just close the Spelling dock window; similarly for annotations.
You can always right click the dock splitter to get them back again.)

<p>
You can add or remove words from a local dictionary (in the file
<tt>words.lst</tt> in the same directory as the PDF file). You can also
change the dictionary language to any language for which you have
dictionary support by clicking the <b>Language</b> button and choosing.
(<font color="darkgreen">ViewPDF</font> will remember your choice
between sessions.)

<h3 id="dock">Dock Windows</h3>
<p>The Controls, Spelling, and Annotation views are in dock
widgets&mdash;these can be dragged into other dock areas (in which case
they will reshape themselves as necessary), or dragged to float free.
The Spelling and Annotations views can also be closed; right click a
dock area splitter and check their checkbox to open them again.

<h3 id="cli">Command Line Usage</h3>
<p>Although <font color="darkgreen">ViewPDF</font> is a GUI program, if
run from a console you can optionally specify a PDF file as its first
argument, and optionally specify a page number to start at as its second
argument.
